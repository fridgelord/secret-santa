## Secret santa
A website where users can be split into random pairs to give presents and, if necessary, communicate between each other to facilitate the gift selection process.

## Modules
[ ] Interface for entering the list of users:
- names
- incompatible pairs - e.g. if we don't want spouses to get a present to one another
- who can speak on another person's behalf - e.g. if you want to make a surprise for someone 
you can ask them for opinion or recommendation

[ ] Script to draw pairs
- "Draw" button
- Send out emails 

[ ] Interface to log in and discuss presents 
- either specific URL login or proper one with credentials
- after logging in you can check who you're buying the present for 
- you also have a text box for asking questions
- once you've asked the question an email is sent to the "representative" of your receiver
